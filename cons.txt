Reasons I hate linux:

A) viral licensing
   a. The best license i've seen is the MIT license / other permissive licenses
   b. gnu gpl is bad
      i. forces companies to pursue alternative methods to up front payment that can be detrimental
      ii. such as subscriptions for premium services, selling maintenance and convenience services
      iii. removes the for-profit motive from the equation in some cases entirely
B) community
   a. unhealthy obsession with anime girls
   b. bad people
   c. very left wing, to their own detriment
   d. want to seize the means of production (communists)
   e. every minute there is a controversy (see nixOS daily, GNOME's hitler particles, Omarchy, hyprland, Xlibre, and CoC's)
   f. toxic
C) richard stallman
   a. this one's satire (kind of)
D) arbitrary standards of purity
   a. why do you notice the splinter in your brothers eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?
E) open source
   a. yes, this is bad.
   b. cybersecurity issues
      i. the common response to this is we need more funding
      ii. no, you need to make a profit on your software model, and some purists refuse to do that
      iii. what prompted me to make this list is yet again, malware has specifically attacked open source because it is easy to attack
   c. maintenance sucks
   d. arbitrary purity again
F) anti-profit
   a. removing one of the strongest motives of mankind from the equation is a grievous mistake for program quality
      i. many may point to microsoft and apple and say 'for profit didn't help their code! look at all this bloat!'
      ii. the issue is employees are given money for the wrong reasons (and they are monopolies)
      iii. the real way to solve this is to found companies with the idea to have full transparency when it comes to business practices
   b. drives away small or individual businesses that could potentially make huge contributions to linux

//TODO! add gripes about package managers. however, please do not use specific package managers ('I hate nixpkgs naming conventions and bloat!') and instead list issues all package managers have in general. please keep about philosophy and not about technical details)
//TODO! add politics. I'm too scared to touch that rn since I don't even know how this is gonna be recieved. probably gonna be left behind and forgotten anyways

   please! submit merge requests to ADD to this list! no deleting everthing and writing "things i hate about linux: nothing. all hail rmseesus!" and calling it a pull request! xD
