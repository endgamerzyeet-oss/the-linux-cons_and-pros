you'll notice that the pros and cons lists are mirrors of each other. there is a deeper purpose to this. I copy-pasted the cons list and rewrote it to praise linux for its feats of absolutely epic proportions. I did this on purpose; sometimes it takes two perspectives of the same features to truely see the beauty of an idea brought to reality, the idea that software means freedom. I love linux so much.
